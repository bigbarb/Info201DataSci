Climate Change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. We are seeing more intense disasters that are destroying our cities and the homes of wildlife. The features I have chosen the analyze in my Shiny App is the CO2 Production over time(years)


The data set that I am analyzing is Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Our World in Data. The data is collected by the Authors Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser, Edouard Mathieu, Bobbie Macdonald and Pablo Rosado. After examining their git hub repository, the data set is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data which is updated regular to include data on CO2 emissions, other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics. Their data is sourced from many such as the Global Carbon Project, Climate Watch Portal, The BP Statistical Review of World Energy, World Bank, etc. The data is collected to analyze the amount of CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions produced by our world. We want to see the trend between various countries to see which countries is contributing the most to CO2 contribution through out the years and finding ways we can reduced our carbon footprint to limit disasters and preserve wildlife which leads to the preservation of rare species. Some limitations or problems with the data set that I could think of is sample size or lack of reliable data (how is it collected/ How often it is collected). Do the countries measure the CO2 and other green house gas level at the end of every year? or do they measure it periodically through the year (Ex. Every month) to see any trends before coming to a final conclusion. Also we have limited technology meaning limited instruments to measure the levels of CO2 and green house gasses.

For my 5 values of interest, all calculations are done in the 5-values.R file. I calculated " US Mean/Average CO2 production per year", "US max CO2 production between selected time frame (1860 - 2020", "US total CO2 production", "Country with the highest CO2 production", and "Country with the lowest average CO2 production".

For the US Mean/Average CO2 production per year, I got a value of 1.885625e+03 CO2 production per year

For the US max CO2 production between selected time frame (1860 - 2020), I got a value of 6134.521. The max amount of co2 produced between 1860 - 2020.

For the US total CO2 production, I got a value of 416723.1. This means that from all the data collected, throughout time so far, the United States have produced 416723.1 amount of CO2.

For the Country with the highest CO2 production, I got WORLD. This is because all of the countries in this world are collective, we reside on the same planet, so it all contributes to the CO2 production of the world, unless we are comparing our planets CO2 production with other planetary systems in our galaxy.

For the Country with the lowest CO2 production, I got Niue. Niue is an island country in the South Pacific Ocean; Northeast of New Zealand. Its land area is about 261 square kilometres, and its population is projected to be at 1,619 or 1.62 thousand as of July 1st, 2021. Upon doing research, Niues future is affected by climate change even though it produces so little. Niue strategic plan is to build a sustainable future that meets or economic and social need while preserving its culture and the environment. Niue also has a Strategic Energy Road Map (NiSERM) 2015 -2025; this outlines that they want to meet 80% of its electric needs from renewable energy and in return reducing its carbon footprint.

After carefully analyzing the data set provided by Our World in Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, it can be concluded that no matter which country produces the most or the least amount of CO2 and Greenhouse gas emissions, it still all contributes to the climate change on the Earth, thus why I got World for the country with the highest CO2 production. The advancement of humanity, living conditions (fossil fuel, deforestation, greenhouse gases, etc) are contributing to the acceleration of climate change/ global warming; We can see this in the data and graph when the countries start having CO2 level increase. They all increased at different times but nonetheless, it contributed to the CO2 levels in the world.
