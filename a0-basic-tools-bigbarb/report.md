## Data Viz Summary
The data visualization is a bar graph made by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post to accompany the increasing rate of active shooter incidents in the United States between 2000 and 2015. The graph was made using data retrieved from the FBI - Federal Bureau of Investigation - about the number of active shooter incidents annually. Based on the trend of the bar graph data, it can be predicted that as the years go on, the active shooter incidents annually will increase. This means more people are being killed per year by guns and their years left on earth have been lost.

Another important thing to factor is the Constitution of United States of America; In particular the second amendment which is A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. But right now, active shooter incidents are still increasing unless action is taken.
