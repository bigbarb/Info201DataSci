# A2: U.S. COVID Trends

## Overview
In many ways, we have come to understand the gravity and trends in the COVID-19 pandemic through data. Regardless of media source, people are consuming more epidemiological information than ever, primarily through reported figures, charts, and maps.

This assignment is your opportunity to work directly with the same data used by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/). While the analysis is guided through a series of questions, it is your opportunity to use programming skills to ask more detailed questions about the pandemic.

## Getting Started
You should start this assignment by opening up the `analysis.R` script. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data.

* **Coding prompts.** Complete the coding prompts in `analysis.R`.

* **Reflection prompts.** Throughout `analysis.R`, there are prompts labeled `"Reflection"`. Please write at least 1-3 sentences for each of these prompts below in this `README.md` file. As appropriate, provide evidence, give justification for your opinions, or genuinely reflect on your views. Please strive for concise, clear, and interesting writing.

## Reflection 1
Before actually calculating the total number of COVID cases and deaths, record your guesses for the following questions.

Guess: How many total COVID cases do you think there have been in the U.S.?

*__I think there have been 3 million total cases of covid in the US considering the population of the country.__*

Guess: How many total COVID-related deaths do you think there have been in the U.S.?

*__I think there have been 80,000 related covid deaths in the US. 30-50% of them will lead to deaths__*

Guess: Which state do you think has the highest number of COVID cases, and which state do you think has the lowest?

*__I think California might have the highest number of COVID cases due to its large population, and Wyoming has the lowest number of COVID cases due to its small population__*

## Reflection 2
Did the number of COVID cases and deaths surprise you? Why or why not? What about the states with the highest and lowest number of cases? How did your guesses line up with the actual results? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

*__The number of COVID cases and deaths surprised Me. I know the US had many waves but was shocked about my estimation about the number of cases in the US. I was correct about my prediction in terms of the state of California having the highest cases due to its large population but I was wrong about the lowest. I picked a random state from the midwest knowing the costal parts of the US have a much larger population. However, America Samoa had the least number of cases.__*

## Reflection 3
Which county has the highest number of cases in the state of Washington, and does it surprise you? Why or why not? (You may need to google this county to learn about it) Answer at least in 1-3 sentences

*__King County is the County with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Washington. It does not surprise me. King County is one of the largest Countys in Washington State. King County also has some of The major cities also! Seattle is very popular and has a large tourist attraction. I also grew up in King County and I see people everywhere.__*

## Reflection 4
Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable `lowest_deaths_in_each_state`? That is, wouldn't you expect the number to be around 50? Why is the number greater than 50? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

*__There are so many observations (counties) in the variable 'lowest_deaths_in_each_state' because it has two data frames (multiple data) from the states and its countys that has the lowest number of covid related deaths in each state. In addition, there are alot of counties with ZERO covid related deaths and they are still included in the data set. Thus why the number is greater than 50.__*

## Reflection 5
What do you think about the number and scale of the inconsistencies in the data? Does the fact that there are inconsistencies mean that people should not use this data? Why or why not? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

*__I think not every data is going to be perfect so I expected the data to contain some inconsistencies (31 compared to 2 million). But the people and companies extracting the data should make it as true (100%) as possible. I think people should still use this data as not all data is perfect and this will give them insight onto the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.__*

## Reflection 6
Why were you interested in this particular question? Were you able to answer your question with code? What did you learn? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

*__I am interested in this particular question because I have family and friends that live in Phoenix Arizona which is in Maricopa County. I was able to find out how many cases resided in the county. I was not surprised as Phoenix is one of the major cities in Arizona.__*

## Reflection 7
What, if anything, made you curious about this COVID analysis? What, if anything, surprised you? What might you do the same or differently on your next data wrangling project? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences

*__What made me curious about this COVID analysis assignment was how high the death and case counts were. And I was interested in learning about it varied through county, state, and nationally since parts of the US were so differently culturally and population wise.__*
